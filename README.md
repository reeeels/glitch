2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
   // In creating this submission, I tried adding more effects and elements of my own to the css stylesheet, and I did get some syntax wrong. For the elements I couldbA challenging part for me was trying to understand the javascript functions, especially the "playClueSequence()". I am learning a lot of HTML and CSS at the moment, but I am yet to take javascript part, and so it feels new to me.
   
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   //After completing this submission, it feels like JavaScript is the big one. I do understand the concept of web dev and the use of html ,css, and Javascript, but I want to ask if there are other applications or use of JavaScript asides in web dev. I also want to get your thoughts on the difficulty and complexity of Javascript. Thanks 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   // If I had more hours to work on this project, I would spend more time on making the website more user-friendly. That will mean more transitions, translations, feedbacks and color schemes to make the site look better. For the game itself, adding various levels of difficulty and speed would be a plus. Adding relatable and already known sounds or words would also add to the replay ability of the game. I would also add tiers or level rewards for streaks and milestones. So, I would spend a part of my time adjusting and revamping the game page, and the rest on creating new functions for difficulties, tiers, and rewards.
